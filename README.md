Python, Python is very smooth to research the syntax emphasizes readability and it is able to reduce time-ingesting in developing. In this mode GitHub, I have explained how to create a LMS in Python with Mysql Database as a backend.
 This project has been done in Python3 and MySQL as back end database management system for library system application programming. In this video you can see that how we install Python 3, then download and install MySQL-python module, then start creating tables of the Database and connecting with the Database table through Python code and also explain some SQL statements in Python and show you how to write them in SQL format and connect to database with python. It is a basic tutorial on building an online Library Management System using Python with MySQL as backend.
